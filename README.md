# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
In this project, I combined computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. As a result from this project the algorithm should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face.
